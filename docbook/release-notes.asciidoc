=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.0.0:
** You can now switch between between Capture and File Format dissection of
the current capture file via the View menu in the Qt GUI.

//=== Removed Dissectors

=== New File Format Decoding Support

Wireshark is able to display the format of some types of files (rather than
displaying the contents of those files). This is useful when you're curious
about, or debugging, a file and its format.  To open a capture file (such as
PCAP) in this mode specify "MIME Files Format" as the file's format in the
Open File dialog.

New files that Wireshark can open in this mode include:

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
